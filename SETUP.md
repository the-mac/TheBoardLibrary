Implementing a Board Project
===============

* Start off with your concept (a Chess adaptation, or something else) and pick a name for it

* The second step in setting up your project is copying the Sample project, and renaming the copied project to your own project's name

* The third step in setting up your project is [creating piece images (dimensions 54 X 138)](https://github.com/the-mac/TheBoardLibrary/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#make-a-piece---image) that suit your game and placing them in the drawables folder

* The next step is [setting Up Your Piece](https://github.com/the-mac/TheBoardLibrary/blob/master/README.md#setting-up-your-pieces) classes and movement logic

* The last step in setting up your project is to [set up your end game logic](https://github.com/the-mac/TheBoardLibrary/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#how-do-i-end-the-game).
